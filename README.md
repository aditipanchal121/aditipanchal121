- 😄 Pronouns: she/her

- 👩🏾‍💻 Currently, I am working as an Applied Scientist at Microsoft, building evaluation metrics for Copilot. I am also working towards my MSCS, with a specialization in Machine Learning, at Georgia Tech.

- 🚀 During summer of 2021, I interned at Microsoft in Cloud and AI, working on writing automated tests for the Quote Center UI of Microsoft Partner Center, thereby reducing testing time by over 85% for the features
     I focused on. I worked with C# and Selenium to develop complex algorithms to be able to compress hundreds of manual tests into single, adaptable workflows.

- 🔭 In summer of 2020, I interned at Capital One as a Software Engineer. I used AWS Lambda and S3 to create a CSV file validation service, that can bulk upload information to a 
     database for the internal application my team is developing. I also worked with DevOps features such as the company pipeline software and lockbox integrations to help implement security and facilitate CI/CD. 

- 🌱 On my own time, I am also learning TensorFlow, and have been learning the theory and implementation behind Artificial Intelligence. So far, I have developed several machine 
     learning algorithms, as well as deep learning neural networks for fun scenarios such as generating Shakespeare-esque plays and predicting car purchase amounts based on  customer demographics. 
     
- 👯 I want to collaborate on projects that contribute towards social good! I have always wanted to do something that directly benefits the lives of others in a meaningful way, and my 
     I am passionate about psychology, as well as machine learning, so I enjoy working on projects that intersect these topics. Feel free to contact me if you are interested in starting something like this!
