- 🔭 I’m currently interning at Capital One as a Software Engineer. I am using AWS Lambda and S3 to create a CSV file validation service, that can bulk upload information to a          database for the internal application my team is developing. I also worked with DevOps features such as the company pipeline software and lockbox integrations to help        
     implement security and facilitate continuous development and integration. 

- 🌱 On my own time, I am also learning TensorFlow, and have been learning the theory and implementation behind Artificial Intelligence. So far, I have developed several machine 
     learning algorithms, as well as deep learning neural networks for fun scenarios such as generating Shakespeare-esque plays and predicting car purchase amounts based on  
     customer demographics. 
     
     I am also learning React, Redux and GraphQL to build a highly functional eCommerce application, to gain experience using these technologies on larger projects.
     
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on projects built for social good. I have always wanted to do something that directly benefits the lives of others in a meaningful way, but my 
     passions also lie in technology. Finding an intersection between the two has been a goal of mine, so feel free to contact me if you are interested in starting something like 
     this!

     As described above, I am also really interested in data, and using it to derive interesting patterns and conclusion, and making it accessible. I love playing around with AI 
     techniques and want to be able to implement algorithms towards a larger project as well.
